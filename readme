# Overview

As a software engineer, Iâ€™m focused on improving my understanding of JavaScript by building interactive, real-world applications. This to-do list web app showcases my ability to work with DOM manipulation, ES6 features, recursion, and third-party libraries.

The app lets users add, remove, and complete tasks, dynamically updating the UI. I built it to deepen my skills in native JavaScript, improve my error-handling logic, and explore external libraries like Lodash.

# Development Environment

I developed the app using Visual Studio Code with a local live server for testing. The project uses HTML, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

I used modern ES6+ features like filter, includes, and push, as well as Lodash (via CDN) to simplify array operations. Recursion is used to render the task list, and try-catch is implemented for basic error handling.
